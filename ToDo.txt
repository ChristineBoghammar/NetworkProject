[] Set up a call. Clients should be able to:
	[x] Accept a call.
	[x] Reject a call.
	[x] Deny call because they're already in an active call.
	[x] Close their connection to a call.
	[x] Send text messages to all call participants.
[] When above is completed. A sound stream should be sent between the call participants.
	[x] Implement Java Sound to send prerecorded audio to call participants
	[] Find a good buffer length so that audio packets arent sent too often and also do not cause a big delay. (50 ms of data is a possible start point)

[] Implement the possibility of sending a voicemail to other people. Should be possible to record the audio file and then send it to the other client directly through the monitor

[] Implement a GUI so that the following is possible:
	[x] Show a list of active clients
	[x] Have the ability to call several participants
		[x] Have the ability to accept a call.
		[x] Have the ability to reject a call.
		[x] Have the ability to end a call.
	[] Show voicemails to the client

** Problem **
There is a significant delay with the audio stream. Possible problem is that the actionlist in ServerMonitor is overflowing with audio stream data.
A solution could be to move the logic for sending audio data to a separate monitor on the server side or to lower the interval between sent audio stream data on the client side.
